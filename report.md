### Task: 1. **Literature Review**

### Key Findings on Literature Review Methodologies

- **Purpose and Importance**: Literature reviews provide foundational knowledge, identify research gaps, contextualize new investigations within existing scholarship, and guide research design (What Is the Purpose and Importance of Literature Reviews in Research, [Pubrica](https://pubrica.com/insights/study-guide/what-is-the-purpose-and-importance-of-literature-reviews-in-research/)).

- **Methodological Rigor**: Traditional literature reviews are evolving to enhance rigor. This includes addressing common pitfalls and improving publication standards, supported by systematic frameworks for conducting reviews (Methods for Literature Reviews, [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK481583/)).

- **Forms of Literature Reviews**: Two predominant forms are recognized:
  1. **Literature Review Section**: Found in journal articles and theses, synthesizing existing literature to expose gaps relevant to new studies.
  2. **Review Article**: An independent work that synthesizes knowledge in a field without presenting new data, often more cited than primary research articles (NCBI).

- **Steps in Conducting Reviews**: The literature review process typically involves: 
  1. Formulating research questions.
  2. Conducting comprehensive literature searches.
  3. Screening for relevant studies.
  4. Assessing quality.
  5. Extracting and analyzing data, often in an iterative manner (NCBI).

- **Cumulative Knowledge in Research**: Literature reviews are essential for sustaining cumulative knowledge in disciplines, vital in rapidly growing fields like eHealth, helping to refine and direct future research efforts (NCBI).

### Task: Research and compile existing studies on the environmental impacts of lithium extraction, focusing on water usage, local ecosystems, and pollution.

### Research Findings on the Environmental Impacts of Lithium Extraction

- **Water Usage & Depletion**: Traditional lithium extraction methods, such as open-pit mining and evaporation ponds, consume vast amounts of water, leading to significant depletion of local water resources, particularly in arid regions like the Salar de Atacama. This creates severe impacts on local communities and ecosystems (The Effects of Lithium Mining, [Climate and Community Institute](https://climateandcommunity.org/research/effects-of-lithium-extraction/)).

- **Pollution from Mining**: The use of toxic chemicals, including sulfuric acid, in lithium extraction contaminates local water sources, posing risks to human health and biodiversity. Polluted water sources affect not only humans but also wildlife, leading to habitat destruction and loss of species (The cost of green energy: lithium mining's impact on nature, [Mining Technology](https://www.mining-technology.com/analyst-comment/lithium-mining-negative-environmental-impact/)).

- **Land Degradation**: Lithium extraction methods cause extensive land disruption and habitat loss, leading to soil erosion and further ecological imbalance. Traditional methods exacerbate these issues compared to newer techniques (Environmental Impact of Lithium Extraction From Produced Water, [Lithium Harvest](https://lithiumharvest.com/knowledge/produced-water-treatment/environmental-impact-of-lithium-extraction-from-produced-water/)).

- **Innovative Extraction Techniques**: The extraction of lithium from produced water (a byproduct of oil and gas extraction) presents a potential solution. This method utilizes existing waste streams, reducing water consumption by up to 96%, and significantly lowering environmental footprints compared to traditional mining (Environmental Impact of Lithium Extraction From Produced Water, [Lithium Harvest](https://lithiumharvest.com/knowledge/produced-water-treatment/environmental-impact-of-lithium-extraction-from-produced-water/)).

- **Carbon Emissions**: While lithium and cobalt mining emits fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels, significant emissions from mining processes still occur. Each tonne of mined lithium can equate to 15 tonnes of CO2, highlighting the ongoing environmental concerns associated with extraction practices (The Environmental Impact of Lithium and Cobalt Mining, [Earth.org](https://earth.org/lithium-and-cobalt-mining/)).

- **Biodiversity Threats**: Ecosystem disruption from lithium mining poses risks to various species, particularly in sensitive habitats. For example, the extraction process can threaten the habitats of species unique to these regions (The Effects of Lithium Mining, [Climate and Community Institute](https://climateandcommunity.org/research/effects-of-lithium-extraction/)).

  - **Apple’s Think Different**: Shifted focus from products to values, fostering a brand narrative centered around innovation and individuality.
  - **Old Spice**: Revamped its image to target younger demographics with viral marketing strategies, effectively broadening its appeal.

- **General Insights on Case Studies:**
  - Case studies provide deep insights into the strategies, challenges, and successes of campaigns, serving as critical tools for learning and growth.
  - Effective case studies often use visual data, customer quotes, and straightforward design to communicate their findings effectively.
  - They help businesses refine their strategies by showcasing practical implementations and the impact of various approaches.
